# 💻 Order Summary | Frontend Mentor

## 📖 Description

This is a Order Summary card component made with HTML, CSS and SASS, based on the challenge provided by *Frontend Mentor*. It was made with the free assets provided, which means the Figma/Sketch files weren't included.

This is my first time coding with SASS, it's not that hard but sure has plenty of resources to explore. I was a little confused at first, but watching a video from *FreeCodeCamp* and reading the docs helped me a lot.

It's a little complicated to make it look as equal as the design using only images, but it's a very neat challenge to do so.
